Console app and Python API implementing a generalization of eigenvalue problem
within the harmonic coupled finite strip method, used for parametric modeling
of static and dynamic inelastic buckling, free vibration, damage and failure in
prismatic shell structures.

This work is a part of the investigation within the research project
[ON174027]_, supported by the Ministry for Science and Technology, Republic of
Serbia. This support is gratefully acknowledged.
